This is the source code for the Android Wear Find My Phone app https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=co.vimo.findmyphone.
It turns your Android Wear watch into a leash for your phone. 

It has three functions:

<ul>
<li> <strong>Alert:</strong> It alerts you when your phone is out of the range of your Android Wear watch. Never forget to carry your phone with you again.</li>

<li> <strong>Find:</strong> You can tap on your Android Wear watch to sound an alarm on the phone. Finding your Phone is so much easier. On the Android Wear watch say "Ok, Google, start Find My Phone" </li>

<li> <strong>Secure:</strong> When your Android Wear watch is out of the Bluetooth range of your phone, the Android Wear Find My Phone App automatically locks your phone. Your phone is always secure.</li>
</ul>

It started out with the code base from Google Android Wear SDK's Find My Phone example. Then we added the phone component so that the App compile and can be installed. Then we added the ability to auto lock. 

Please feel free to submit feature requests and contributions, all changes will be publish in the App store to benefit all Android Wear Users.

The App in the Play store will always be free, no Ad, no in-app purchase, ever.
